# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-
This project uses a pre-trained EfficientNet-B1 model in PyTorch to classify facial expressions into 7 categories (angry, happy, sad, etc.). The included Jupyter Notebook covers the entire pipeline: data loading, image augmentation, training, and a visualization function for inference. The model achieves ~69% validation accuracy after 15 epochs.
